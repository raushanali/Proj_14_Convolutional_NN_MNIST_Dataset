# Proj_14_Convolutional_NN_MNIST_Dataset

# Project Introduction

This project "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - MNIST Dataset" is a machine learning project where handwritten digits are recognized using the MNIST dataset. In this project, a CNN model is built and trained.

## Purpose

- Using deep learning for handwritten digit recognition.
- Training the model on the MNIST dataset and evaluating its performance.
- Developing a basic understanding of image classification.

## Features

- Uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images).
- Training, testing, and visualization of model results.
- Simple code structure so that even beginners can understand.

## Usage Instructions

 **Install Required Packages:**  
   First, install the necessary libraries using the command below:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib
   ```

 **Run the Code:**  
   Run the main Python file (`main.py` or whichever is the main file):
   
   python main.py
   

 **View Results:**  
   After training and testing, the model's performance (accuracy and loss) will be shown on the screen.  
   Predictions for some images will also be visualized.

## How does it work?

- Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded.
- Data Processing: Images are scaled (between 0-1) and reshaped.
- Model Building: The model is built using CNN layers.
- Training: The model is trained on training data.
- Testing: The model is evaluated on test data.
- Results: Accuracy and loss are shown through graphs.

## Importance of the Project

This project is very useful for beginners in machine learning and deep learning. Through this, you can understand image classification and how CNN works.
